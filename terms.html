          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>2. Flight Bookings</h2>
            <p>All flight bookings are subject to availability and the specific conditions of the airline. We act as an agent for the airlines; therefore, your contract for air travel is with the airline directly.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> All prices are subject to change until the booking is confirmed and full payment is received. Taxes, fees, and surcharges may apply and will be disclosed at the time of booking.</li>
              <li><strong>Ticket Details:</strong> It is your responsibility to ensure that all names (as they appear on passports/IDs), dates, and times are correct at the time of booking. Any changes or corrections may incur fees.</li>
              <li><strong>Baggage:</strong> Baggage allowances vary by airline and ticket type. Please check with the specific airline for their current baggage policies.</li>
              <li><strong>Check-in:</strong> Passengers are responsible for checking in for their flights within the airline's specified timeframes.</li>
            </ul>

              <li><strong>Final Payment:</strong> Full payment for all services must be received by the due date specified. Failure to make final payment by the due date may result in cancellation of your booking and forfeiture of your deposit.</li>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Airline Tickets:</strong> Most economy class airline tickets are non-refundable and non-changeable. Any changes or cancellations may incur significant fees or result in the forfeiture of the ticket value.</li>
              <li><strong>Other Services:</strong> Cancellation terms for hotels, tours, and other services will be outlined at the time of booking.</li>
              <li><strong>Refund Process:</strong> If a refund is applicable, it will be processed according to the service provider's policy, and may take several weeks to reflect in your account. Any administrative fees charged by us for processing cancellations will be deducted from the refund amount.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>5. Travel Arrangements and Documentation</h2>
            <p>You are solely responsible for obtaining and carrying all necessary travel documents, including valid passports, visas, health certificates, and any other entry requirements for all countries you will be visiting or transiting through.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Passport Validity:</strong> Many countries require passports to be valid for at least six months beyond your intended date of departure.</li>
              <li><strong>Visas:</strong> Check visa requirements for all destinations well in advance of your travel date.</li>
              <li><strong>Health Requirements:</strong> Be aware of any health advisories, vaccinations, or other health-related entry requirements for your destination.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are not liable for any losses or damages incurred due to your failure to possess the necessary travel documents.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>7. Travel Insurance</h2>
            <p>We strongly recommend purchasing comprehensive travel insurance at the time of booking to cover unforeseen circumstances such as trip cancellation, medical emergencies, lost baggage, and other travel-related incidents.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>We act as an agent only for various service providers (airlines, hotels, etc.). We are not responsible for any acts, omissions, errors, or negligence of these service providers, or for any personal injury, death, property damage, or other loss, accident, delay, or irregularity which may be occasioned through their fault.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
