            <h2>Overview of Flights from London to Antalya</h2>
            <p>
              The flight distance from London to Antalya is approximately 1,800 miles (2,900 km). A direct flight usually takes about 4 hours and 15 minutes to 4 hours and 45 minutes.

            <h2>London Airports Serving Antalya Flights</h2>
            <p>
              You can fly to Antalya from all major London airports, providing excellent coverage across the city: <strong>London Heathrow (LHR):</strong> Primarily served by Turkish Airlines, offering a full-service experience with checked baggage and meals often included. <strong>London Gatwick (LGW):</strong> The main hub for leisure flights to Turkey. Airlines like easyJet, TUI, and SunExpress operate multiple daily flights from here. <strong>London Stansted (STN):</strong> A key airport for budget travelers, with frequent services from Pegasus Airlines, Jet2, and SunExpress. <strong>London Luton (LTN):</strong> Another great low-cost option, with easyJet and SunExpress providing regular connections.

            <h2>Antalya Airport (AYT)</h2>
            <p>
              Antalya Airport (AYT) is the primary gateway to the Turkish Riviera. It has two international terminals (Terminal 1 and Terminal 2) which are quite far apart, so check your departure terminal on your return journey. The airport is modern and handles millions of tourists annually. It is located about 13km (8 miles) from the city center, with easy transfers to popular resort towns like Belek, Side, and Kemer.

            <h2>Airlines Flying from London to Antalya</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Turkish Airlines:</strong> Offers a premium experience, usually from Heathrow and Gatwick. Great for those who want comfort and reliability. <strong>SunExpress:</strong> A joint venture between Turkish Airlines and Lufthansa. They offer a reliable, value-for-money service with decent legroom and are very popular on this route. <strong>Pegasus Airlines:</strong> Turkey's leading low-cost carrier. They offer competitive fares, especially from Stansted, but check baggage fees as they can add up. <strong>Jet2:</strong> Known for their friendly service and generous 22kg baggage allowance on package bookings. A favorite for families flying from Stansted. <strong>TUI Airways:</strong> The charter giant offers flight-only options from Gatwick, Luton, and Stansted. They use modern aircraft like the Boeing 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner.

            <h2>Flight Prices</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Economy Class:</strong> In the low season (winter), return tickets can be as cheap as £80 - £120. During the peak summer school holidays (July/August), prices jump significantly, often ranging from £300 to over £500 for a return ticket. <strong>Business Class:</strong> While true lie-flat business class is rare on this route (except for some Turkish Airlines flights via Istanbul), "business" class on narrow-body jets usually means a blocked middle seat and better meal service, costing around £400 - £800.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h2>Best Time to Book</h2>
            <p>
              For summer travel, <strong>January and February</strong> are the best months to book to secure early-bird prices. Last-minute deals to Antalya are becoming rarer, especially for families needing multiple seats together. For the best value, consider traveling in <strong>May or October</strong>—the weather is warm but not scorching, and flights are significantly cheaper than in August.

            <h2>Entry Requirements for UK Travelers</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Visa:</strong> UK citizens traveling for tourism can visit Turkey without a visa for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. <strong>Passport:</strong> Your passport must be valid for at least 150 days (approx. 5 months) from the date you arrive in Turkey. This is strictly enforced. <strong>Currency:</strong> The currency is the Turkish Lira (TRY), though Euros and Pounds are widely accepted in tourist areas. It's still recommended to carry some Lira for small purchases.
